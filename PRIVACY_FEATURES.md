# Privacy Features - Hiding Presents for Identified Users

## How It Works

When a user identifies themselves as a recipient, their presents are **completely hidden** to preserve the surprise!

## What Identified Users See

### 1. Surprise Message
```
🎁 Niespodzianka!
Twoje prezenty są ukryte, żeby nie zepsuć niespodzianki. 
Nie możesz zobaczyć, co zostało kupione ani zarezerwowane.
```

### 2. Only Their Own Added Presents
Users can see and manage presents **they added themselves**:
- ✅ View their own present ideas
- ✅ Edit their own presents
- ✅ Delete their own presents

### 3. What's Hidden
- ❌ Presents added by others
- ❌ Whether presents are checked/bought
- ❌ Who reserved what
- ❌ Reservation status
- ❌ Purchase status
- ❌ Any hints about surprises!

## Example Scenario

### User "Anna" Identifies Herself

**Before Identification:**
```
Anna's Presents:
- Gaming PC (added by John) - Reserved by Mike ✓
- Books (added by Sarah) - Checked ✓
- Headphones (added by Anna) - Not reserved
```

**After Identification:**
```
🎁 Niespodzianka!
Twoje prezenty są ukryte...

Twoje dodane prezenty:
- Headphones [Edit] [Delete]
```

Anna can only see the present **she added herself**, and has no idea what others are planning!

## Privacy Levels

| User Type | Can See | Can't See |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Identified User** | Own added presents | Others' presents, status |
| **Other Users** | All presents, reservations | Nothing hidden |
| **Non-Identified** | All presents, status | Nothing hidden |

## Code Logic

```javascript
if (isIdentified) {
    // Show surprise message
    showSurpriseMessage();
    
    // Only show presents created by this user
    const ownPresents = presents.filter(p => p.created_by === currentUserId);
    showOwnPresents(ownPresents);
    
    // Hide everything else!
} else {
    // Show all presents with full details
    showAllPresents();
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Preserves surprises** - Recipients don't know what's coming
✅ **Maintains excitement** - No spoilers!
✅ **Allows participation** - Users can still add their own ideas
✅ **Flexible** - Users can un-identify if they want to see everything

## User Flow

### Identifying

2. Confirms identification
3. **Presents immediately hidden** ⚡
4. Surprise message shown

### Un-identifying
1. User clicks "Anuluj identyfikację"
2. Confirms cancellation

## Summary

The app **prioritizes privacy** by:
1. **Hiding all present details** for identified users
