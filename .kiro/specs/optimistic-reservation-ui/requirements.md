# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The present reservation button currently waits for server response before updating the UI, creating a laggy user experience. This feature will implement optimistic UI updates so the button responds immediately to user clicks, providing instant visual feedback while the server request completes in the background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immediate Button State Update

**User Story:** As a user, I want the reservation button to update immediately when I click it, so that the interface feels responsive and I get instant feedback on my action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the reserve button THEN the button SHALL immediately change to the "reserved" state
2. WHEN a user clicks the unreserve button THEN the button SHALL immediately change to the "unreserved" state
3. WHEN the button state changes THEN the visual appearance SHALL update instantly without waiting for server response
4. WHEN the button updates optimistically THEN it SHALL be temporarily disabled to prevent double-clicks

### Requirement 2: Server Response Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle server errors gracefully, so that if my reservation fails, the button reverts to the correct state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server request succeeds THEN the optimistic state SHALL be confirmed and remain
2. WHEN the server request fails THEN the button state SHALL revert to the previous state
3. IF the server request fails THEN an error message SHALL be displayed to the user
4. WHEN the server response is received THEN the button SHALL be re-enabled for further interactions

### Requirement 3: Visual Feedback During Request

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see subtle feedback that my action is being processed, so that I know the system is working even though the button updated immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reservation request is in progress THEN the button SHALL show a subtle loading indicator
2. WHEN the request completes successfully THEN the loading indicator SHALL be removed
3. WHEN the request fails THEN the loading indicator SHALL be removed before reverting state
4. WHEN the button is disabled during request THEN it SHALL have a visual indication of being disabled

### Requirement 4: State Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the reservation state to remain consistent across page refreshes and multiple views, so that I always see accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is refreshed THEN the reservation state SHALL reflect the server's authoritative state
2. WHEN multiple users view the same present THEN each SHALL see the correct reservation status
3. IF an optimistic update fails THEN the UI SHALL sync with the server state
4. WHEN the presents list is reloaded THEN all reservation states SHALL be accurate
