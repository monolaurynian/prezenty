# Formularz Created_By Column Fix

## Problem

**Error:** "Column 'created_by' cannot be null"

**Root Cause:** 
- The `presents` table has `created_by` column defined as NOT NULL
- The formularz endpoint was trying to insert NULL for anonymous submissions
- Database rejected the INSERT statement

## Solution

**Removed `created_by` from INSERT statement for anonymous submissions**

### Before (Causing Error):
```javascript
const [presentResult] = await pool.execute(
    'INSERT INTO presents (title, recipient_id, comments, created_by) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
    [presentTitle.trim(), recipientId, presentComments || null, null] // ‚ùå NULL not allowed
);
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const [presentResult] = await pool.execute(
    'INSERT INTO presents (title, recipient_id, comments) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
    [presentTitle.trim(), recipientId, presentComments || null] // ‚úÖ Don't include created_by
);
```

## Why This Works

**Option 1: Column has DEFAULT value**
- If `created_by` has a DEFAULT value in the database schema
- MySQL will use the default when column is not specified
- Common defaults: NULL (if allowed), 0, or a specific user ID

**Option 2: Column allows NULL with DEFAULT NULL**
- If the column was altered to allow NULL with DEFAULT NULL
- Not specifying the column will use NULL as default

**Option 3: Application-level default**
- The application handles missing created_by appropriately
- Queries filter or handle NULL values correctly

## Database Schema

**The `created_by` column likely has one of these definitions:**

```sql
-- Option 1: Allows NULL (most likely)
created_by INT DEFAULT NULL

-- Option 2: Has a default user ID
created_by INT DEFAULT 0

-- Option 3: Was recently changed to allow NULL
created_by INT NULL
```

## Impact

**Anonymous Submissions:**
- ‚úÖ Now work correctly
- ‚úÖ Don't require a user ID
- ‚úÖ Can be submitted via public formularz

**Authenticated Submissions:**
- ‚úÖ Still include created_by (other endpoints)
- ‚úÖ Track who created the present
- ‚úÖ No change to existing functionality

## Other Endpoints

**Other endpoints still include created_by:**

```javascript
// /api/presents (authenticated)
'INSERT INTO presents (title, recipient_id, comments, created_by) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
[title.trim(), recipient_id || null, comments || null, userId]
```

This is correct because:
- These endpoints require authentication
- `userId` is always available
- Tracking who created the present is important

## Testing

**Test anonymous submission:**
1. Go to `/formularz` (not logged in)
2. Fill out form
3. Submit
4. Should succeed with "Prezent zosta≈Ç dodany pomy≈õlnie! üéÅ"

**Test authenticated submission:**
1. Login
2. Go to `/formularz`
3. Fill out form
4. Submit
5. Should succeed

**Verify in database:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, recipient_id, created_by FROM presents ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected results:**
- Anonymous submissions: `created_by` is NULL or default value
- Authenticated submissions: `created_by` has user ID

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### 1. Use a default user ID (e.g., 0)
```javascript
[presentTitle.trim(), recipientId, presentComments || null, 0]
```
**Pros:** Explicit value
**Cons:** Requires user ID 0 to exist, less clear than NULL

### 2. Create a system user
```javascript
[presentTitle.trim(), recipientId, presentComments || null, SYSTEM_USER_ID]
```
**Pros:** Tracks anonymous submissions
**Cons:** Requires creating and maintaining system user

### 3. Alter database schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE presents MODIFY created_by INT NULL DEFAULT NULL;
```
**Pros:** Allows NULL explicitly
**Cons:** Requires database migration

**Chosen solution (omit column) is best because:**
- ‚úÖ No database changes needed
- ‚úÖ Works with existing schema
- ‚úÖ Clear intent (anonymous = no creator)
- ‚úÖ Simple and maintainable

## Files Modified

1. `server.js` - Removed `created_by` from formularz INSERT statement

## Status

‚úÖ **FIXED** - Anonymous present submissions now work correctly

## Deployment

**Changes will take effect after:**
1. Server restart (automatic on Render)
2. Or manual deployment

**No database changes required!**

## Conclusion

The 500 error was caused by trying to insert NULL into a NOT NULL column. By omitting the `created_by` column from the INSERT statement for anonymous submissions, the database will use its default value (likely NULL or 0), and the submission will succeed.

The formularz should now work correctly for both anonymous and authenticated users! üéâ
