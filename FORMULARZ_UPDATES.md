# Formularz Updates - Standard Form with Dropdown

## Changes Made

### 1. Form Redesign
- **Removed**: Login-style card with snowflakes
- **Added**: Standard Bootstrap card with clean, professional styling
- **Layout**: Centered form in a responsive card layout
- **Info Banner**: Blue info alert with the holiday message instead of styled text

### 2. Recipient Selection Dropdown
- **Purpose**: Prevent duplicate names in the database
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown populated with existing recipients from database
  - "Choose from list..." placeholder option
  - "+ Add new name" option (highlighted in blue)
  - When "+ Add new name" is selected, a text input appears below
  - Automatically loads all existing recipients on page load

### 3. New API Endpoint
```javascript
GET /api/formularz/recipients
```
- Returns list of all recipients (id and name)
- No authentication required
- Used to populate the dropdown

### 4. Updated Form Fields
- **Recipient Selection**: Dropdown with dynamic loading
- **Present Title**: Standard text input with label
- **Comments**: Textarea with label
- **Submit Button**: Large green success button

### 5. Authentication Modal Updates
- Removed snowflakes and special styling
- Standard Bootstrap modal design
- Clean form labels instead of input groups
- Proper close button in header
- Standard primary/success button colors

### 6. JavaScript Updates
- `loadRecipients()`: Fetches and populates dropdown
- Updated `submitPresent()`: Handles both dropdown selection and new name input
- Dropdown change handler: Shows/hides new name input field
- Auto-reloads recipients after adding a new one

## User Experience Flow

### Adding a Present:
1. User visits `/formularz`
2. Sees a clean, standard form
3. Clicks the "Your name" dropdown
4. Options:
   - Select existing name from list (prevents duplicates)
   - Select "+ Add new name" to enter a new name
5. Fills in present details
6. Submits form
7. If new name was added, dropdown refreshes with the new name included

### Benefits:
- **No Duplicates**: Users see existing names and can select them
- **Consistency**: Same person can add multiple presents without creating duplicate entries
- **Clean UI**: Professional, standard form design
- **User-Friendly**: Clear labels and instructions
- **Responsive**: Works on all devices
