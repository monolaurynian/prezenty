# Formularz Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. New HTML Page: `public/formularz.html`
A new page with two main sections:
- **Add Present Tab**: Public form where anyone can add presents without authentication
- **Edit My Presents Tab**: Protected section requiring authentication to edit/delete own presents

**Features:**
- Christmas-themed design matching the login page
- Snowflake animations
- Responsive navigation tabs
- Authentication modal with login/register options (slides in like registration page)
- Intro text: "üéÑ NadchodzƒÖ ≈õwiƒôta! üéÅ Dodaj swoje pomys≈Çy na prezenty..."

### 2. JavaScript File: `public/formularz.js`
Handles all client-side functionality:
- Tab switching between "Add" and "Edit" modes
- Form submission for adding presents (no auth required)
- Authentication modal with login/register forms
- Loading and displaying user's presents
- Editing and deleting presents
- Error handling and user feedback

### 3. Server Endpoints in `server.js`

#### New Endpoints:
```javascript
// Public endpoint - no authentication required
POST /api/formularz/present
- Accepts: recipientName, presentTitle, presentComments
- Creates or finds recipient by name
- Adds present to database
- Returns: success status

// Protected endpoint - requires authentication
GET /api/formularz/my-presents
- Returns all presents for the authenticated user's identified recipient
- Returns empty array if user hasn't identified themselves

// Route to serve the page
GET /formularz
- Serves the formularz.html page
```

### For Developers:

   ```

2. **Access the page:**

3. **Test the features:**
   - Add presents without logging in
   - Try to edit presents (should show auth modal)
   - Login/register and edit presents

## Database Integration

- Uses existing `recipients` table
- Uses existing `presents` table
- Anonymous submissions have `created_by = NULL`
- Authenticated users link presents to their identified recipient
- Automatic recipient creation/lookup by name

- Input validation on both client and server side

## Browser Compatibility

- Mobile responsive
- Progressive Web App compatible
- Works with existing service worker

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Categories/tags for presents
- Search and filter functionality
- Export presents to PDF/print
